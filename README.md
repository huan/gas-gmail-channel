function firstStep(req, res, next) {
  Logger.log('Mail Subject: ' 
             + '[' + req.thread.getFirstMessageSubject() + ']')
  req.data = 'This data was set in the firstStep'
  next()
}

function secondStep(req, res, next) {
  Logger.log('Data got by secondStep: '
             + '[' + req.data + ']')
  // NO next() here
}

function thirdStep(req, res,next) {
  throw Error('should not run to here')
}
```

### Channel

`GmailChannel` is created to filter emails that match specific conditions. After you created a Channel, you can attach `Middleware` to handle emails from channel.

### Middleware

`Middleware` is a set of functions that do the work. In GmailChannel, the middleware works very similar as `Express`.

```javascript
function (req, res, next) {
  var thread = req.thread
  // deal with emails in thread
}
```

### `GmailChannel.getName()`

instance method `getName()` will return Channel Name for current instance.

### `req.getThread()`: Email thread filtered out by Channel

method `req.getThread()` return a [Class GmailThread](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/gmail/gmail-thread) object in GAS(Google Apps Script).

### `req.getChannelName()`: Channel Name of req

method `req.getChannelName()` will return the current channel name.

## How to enable GmailChannel in your code<a name="library"></a>
