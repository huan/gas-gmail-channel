### Channel

`Channel` is created for filter emails that match specified conditions. After you created a Channel, you can attach `Middleware` to deal with emails from channel.

### Middleware

`Middleware` is a set of functions that do the work. In GmailChannel, the middleware is very like `Express`.

```javascript
function (req, res, next) {
  // deal with emails
}
```

### `req.thread`: Email thread filtered out by Channel

`req.thread` is a [Class GmailThread](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/gmail/gmail-thread) object in GAS(Google Apps Script).

## How to use GmailChannel in your code
